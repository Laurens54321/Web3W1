Ik heb contact vervangen met reservation in context van een sporthal.
Alles zou hetzelfde uitgewerkt zijn maar met reservation ipv contact.

Ik heb hieronder de belangrijkste Userstories opnieuw geschreven met mijn kleine aanpassingen.


Story W06 Add reservation

As a logged in user
I want to register a reservation
So that people who were present when I was can be contacted when I test positive for COVID

Acceptance Criteria
At the bottom of the profile page there is a form to register a new reservation under my name
A user needs to enter his/her first name, last name, date, hour , field which they want to hire, phone nr and email address.
All fields are mandatory
If a mandatory field is not filled in or a field contains invalid information, the form is not sent (client side validation). For security reasons there is also server side validation. All correct fields stay filled in.
After the form is submitted, the profile page is shown again. The reservation should be added to the my reservations page.


Story W08

As a logged in user
I want to be able to search for all the reservations that came after me if I tested positive for Covid so I can warn them to go into quarantine.

Acceptance Criteria
From the homepage, a logged-in user should be able to navigate to the search page
When on the search page, the logged-in user sees all the reservations that have visited since the positive covid test. Each reservation is given by date, name, email and phone nr. If there are no reservations or there are no registered positive tests, an appropriate message is given.
